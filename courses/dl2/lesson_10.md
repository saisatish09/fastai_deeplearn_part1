## Review of Last Week
- if you are finding the material difficult, that's ok
- there are quite a few in-class fastai students who are doing this full-time and some of them are struggling with this material
- one of the reasons Jeremy had that content early on is we've got something to **cogitate** and think about and gradually work towards so by Lesson 14, you'll get a second crack at it

## Reading Papers (Research Journal Publications)
- not enough students are reading the papers!  The papers are the real ground truth
- a lot of people aren't reading the papers because they think they can't read the papers, but YOU ARE, because you are here

### Debugger
```python
pdb.set_trace()
```
### `00:14:20` NLP
- we've seen the idea of taking a pre-trained model, whip off some stuff from the top, replace it with new stuff, get it to do something similar
- we've dived a little bit deeper with that; with ConvLearner.pretrained, it had a standard way of sticking stuff on the top which does a particular thing, which was classification
- and then we learned, we can stick any PyTorch module at the end and have it do anything we like with a custom head
- suddenly you discover there are some interesting things we can do
- `00:15:35` YangLu said, what if we did a different kind of custom head? 
    - take original picture, rotate it, and then make our dependent variable the opposite of that rotation
    - and see if it can learn to un-rotate it
    - and this is a super useful thing, Google photos has an option to automatically rotate photos for you
    - as Yang Lu showed here, you could build that network right now by doing exactly the same as our previous lesson, but your custom head is one that spits out a single number, which is how much to rotate by and your dataset has a dependent variable which is how much did you rotate by?  And your dataset has a dependent variable, which is how much did you rotate by?
- so, you suddenly realize the idea of a backbone with a custom head, you can do almost anything you can think about
- Next, let's think about, how does that apply to NLP?


### Match the Equations to the Code
- [List of Mathematical Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols)

### Re-create things (graphs) you see in the papers
- "Try to recreate this chart, and make sure you understand what it's saying and why it matters"

### `00:16:40` We've moved from *torchtext* to *fastai.text*
- no parallel processing
- hard to do simple things (like multi-label classification)
- no obvious way to save intermediate calculations
- somewhat convoluted API
- looking at transformations to images and asking "how does that apply to NLP?"
- in Part 1 we used the library, torchtext, but JH has found problems with it that are limiting; it's very slow because it's not doing parallel processing and doesn't remember what it did previously, so reruns it
- refresher: look at lesson 4, IMDb reviews
- we take sentences and turn them into numbers
